This project is a full-stack web application that demonstrates real-time, multi-user collaboration. Moving beyond standard CRUD applications, it uses WebSockets to create a shared space where the mouse cursors of all connected users are visible and move in real-time. This project serves as a foundational exploration into the architecture of modern collaborative software like Google Docs or Figma.

‚ú® **Key Features**:

Real-Time Cursor Tracking: See the cursors of multiple users move on the screen simultaneously with low latency.

WebSocket Communication: Built on a lightweight Node.js WebSocket server for persistent, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

Dynamic UI: A responsive React frontend that efficiently renders cursor movements for all connected clients without performance degradation.

Scalable Foundation: The core architecture is designed to be easily extended with more advanced collaborative features.
